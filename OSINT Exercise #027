Following exercise: https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/osint-exercise-027/

There are three questions in total 1. Who is the speaker 2. What was he wearing on his lapel 3. Find footage of the speech.

The title of the speech is displayed on the large monitor in the background. By using the title “Lectura en Movimiento en Lima” and google you can find articles that talk about the event. In one of those articles the director of the OEI is mentioned his name is Juan Carlos Ruiz. To confirm 
that he is the speaker we can just compare the photos we found with what we are given in the exercise.

To look for what he was wearing on his lapel you use the title and the name of the director with this combination you only get search results that include the director and the event. Upon closer inspection of a photo in one article it seems he is wearing a badge that signifies that he is the director of the 
OEI in peru.

Finally to find footage of the event you can just search for it by using the title and the keyword footage then you can find the full footage on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVU-ei4Dunk.
