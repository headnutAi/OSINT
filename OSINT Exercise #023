There are two questions 1. Find the name of the art piece 2. Find out how much a similar piece would cost

You need to find the video which is mentioned https://youtu.be/z9gr8yRSPZg?t=218. Then you can use the windows snippet tool to cut out the part of the wallpaper.
To find out who drew it you can use google's own image searcher. Upon a quick search you can discover a link to an inPrint profile which sells the same picture https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/adamscythe/.
So you have two birds one stone because you get the title aswell as the price for the art piece.
